# Part I: Why?

---
class: center, middle
# What do you percieve as a global health problem?

---
class: center, middle
# What action could you take?

---
class: center, middle
# What information do you need?

---
class: center, middle
# What data do you need to get that information?

---
class: center, middle
# How can we collect that data?

* __event__: disease marker, risk factors...

--
* __classification__: applying a definition

--
* __data__: structured items (excel-sheet) usually on time, place person

--
* __information__: data with meaning, trends, outbreaks...

--
* __action__: interventions, policy change, resource planing..

# Part IV: Classification of surveillance systems

---
# Classifcation of surveillance system
* Indicator-based vs event-based surveillance
* Passive or active surveillance
* Sentinal surveillance
* Syndromic surveillance
* Lab vs clinician-based surveillance


---
# Whats NOT a surveillance system

  Surveillance    | Science
  :---------------|:-------------
  ongoing         | temporary
  problem known   | problem unkown
  no intervention | intervention
  action driven   | hypothesis driven

class: center, middle, inverse

# Part V: Problems

---
background-image: url({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/2021_10_28_CIEE/underreporting_pyramid.png)
# Typical problem: underreporting

---
background-image: url({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/2021_10_28_CIEE/timeliness.png)

# Typical problem: timeliness

---

# Typical problem: event definition

* norovirus causes gastroenteritis
* case defintion: lab + gastroenteritis
* lab reports come on their own
* info on gastroenteritis must come from patient
* if you dont ask the patient -> less cases
Solutions tried:
* Monitor lab reports as well
* Analyze the system often

---
# Typical problem: change

* Surveillance systems dont like change
* Example: people see less doctors --> less cases

Solutions tried:
* Create resilient systems

---
# Typical problem: costs and motivation

* No reimbursment -> no reporting
* Lots of reimbursment -> invented cases

Solutions tried
* Establish a strong legal system
* Sentinal surveillance

---
# Typical problem: unkown event

* New events are difficult to monitor
* Example Anatoxin A

Solutions tried:
* invest in networks
* event based surveillance

---
# Typical problem: close to elimination

* nearly eliminated diseases increase false alarms
* example measles: 80% false alarms

Solutions tried:
* adjust case definition

# Part VI: Questions

---
class: center, middle
# Is a single survey a surveillance system?

---
class: center, middle
# What problems would you expect with the Wikipedia Surveillance?

---
class: center, middle
# How would you setup a surveillance system for drug abuse?

- Is there action that helps?
- What information do we need?
- What data do we need?
- How can we collect data?
