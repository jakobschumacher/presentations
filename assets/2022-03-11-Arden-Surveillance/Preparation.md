## About the lesson
Surveillance system monitor a global health problem. In this lesson you will learn about the principles of a surveillance system, different classifications and common problems. The aim is to make you aware of the concept of surveillance systems, so that you can use and interpret such a system in your future life.

## Preparation
Think about a global health problem that you are interested in. Think about a potential remedy or solution to that problem. Be prepared to talk about the problem and the solution that you came up with. In the lesson we will try to create a suveillance system for your public health problem. For example I would choose the following example: In Papua New Guinea Malaria is a common health problem ([https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/papua-new-guinea-malaria/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/papua-new-guinea-malaria/)). One remedy would be to install mosquito nets. For those of you who want to think futher: What kind of information do you need to implement the solution? What kind of data do you need to get to that information?
